# 📌 NLP-Detection-of-Fake-News
The aim of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fake news. The model will be integrated into the Chrome plug-in and will provide users with real-time feedback on the veracity of the news they are reading.

## 🎯 Project objectives


##### *1. The main objective of the project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying fake news.
The secondary objectives will be:
2. Data analysis
a) Is fake news more common in certain categories?
b) Are there topics more commonly associated with fake news?
c) Do fake news headlines follow recurring patterns?
3. Training model
    a) Which combination of NLP and machine learning techniques leads to the best model?
4. Model evaluation
    a) What types of performance metrics should be used to evaluate the model's efficiency?

## 🧠 Conclusions
- This project allowed me to manage a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow, from data preparation to modelling and visualization.
  I applied different analytical techniques — including RFM segmentation, Yeo–Johnson transformation and K-Means clustering — and learned
  how these methods can be combined to extract actionable insights about customer behaviour.

- The project also help me to improve my ability to structure work efficiently and select the appropriate tools (SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau) based on the business questions.
  Overall, this experience gave me a base for future customer analytics and segmentation projects.
