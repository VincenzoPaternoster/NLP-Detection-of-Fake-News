# 📌 NLP-Detection-of-Fake-News
The aim of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fake news. The model will be integrated into the Chrome plug-in and will provide users with real-time feedback on the veracity of the news they are reading.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
Key operations performed:
- Handling missing values
- Format correction (dates, numbers, etc.)
- Duplicate removal
- Handling negative and inconsistent values
- Feature engineering (e.g. obtaining season from date)
---

## 📊 Methodology:
- Used techniques (RFM segmentation,k-means clustering,Yeo-Johnson transformation,Standardization)
- Main libraries (Pandas,Numpy,Sklearn,Scipy,Matplotlib,Seaborn)

  Yeo–Johnson transformation applied to the RFM features to reduce skewness and stabilize variance [See variables distributions](https://github.com/VincenzoPaternoster/E-commerce-sales-analysis/blob/main/Images/Distributions/RFM_Features_distributions.png)

  The original distributions of Frequency, Recency and Monetary were highly skewed, and K-Means is sensitive to extreme values [See extreme values](https://github.com/VincenzoPaternoster/E-commerce-sales-analysis/blob/main/Images/Distributions/BoxPlot_Outliers.png)

  Yeo–Johnson was chosen because, unlike Box–Cox or log transformation, it can handle zero values (present in Recency) [See difference between trasformations](https://github.com/VincenzoPaternoster/E-commerce-sales-analysis/tree/main/Images/Distributions)

  After the transformation, the features were standardized before fitting the clustering model.

## 🔍 Key results
- Insight 1: Revenue in 2024 presents high volatility in all the quarters [Revenue Trend Linechart](https://github.com/VincenzoPaternoster/E-commerce-sales-analysis/blob/main/Images/Business%20Insights/Revenue_trend.png)
  
  There are several peaks but the overall direction is slightly upward, indicating a soft improvement in sales throughout the year.
- Insight 2: There are products that need to be eliminated, recalibrated and promoted [Products identified](https://github.com/VincenzoPaternoster/E-commerce-sales-analysis/blob/main/Images/Business%20Insights/Products_to.png)
- Insight 3: The best product in terms of revenue is 212 [Best and worst products by revenue](https://github.com/VincenzoPaternoster/E-commerce-sales-analysis/blob/main/Images/Business%20Insights/Best_Worst_Products.png)
- Insight 4: The most used channel is the web, followed by mobile [Most used channel](https://github.com/VincenzoPaternoster/E-commerce-sales-analysis/blob/main/Images/Business%20Insights/Revenue_channel.png)
- Insight 5: E-commerce customers can be divided into five clusters based on RFM characteristics. Actionable commercial strategies have been provided for each cluster [Clustering](https://github.com/VincenzoPaternoster/E-commerce-sales-analysis/tree/main/Images/Clustering)
- Insight 6: Each cluster has different patterns based on RFM characteristics that guide commercial strategies [RFM](https://github.com/VincenzoPaternoster/E-commerce-sales-analysis/blob/main/Images/RFM%20Insights/AllCharts_RFM.png)

## 🧠 Conclusions
- This project allowed me to manage a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow, from data preparation to modelling and visualization.
  I applied different analytical techniques — including RFM segmentation, Yeo–Johnson transformation and K-Means clustering — and learned
  how these methods can be combined to extract actionable insights about customer behaviour.

- The project also help me to improve my ability to structure work efficiently and select the appropriate tools (SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau) based on the business questions.
  Overall, this experience gave me a base for future customer analytics and segmentation projects.
